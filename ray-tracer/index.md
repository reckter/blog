# Ray Tracer

A friend of mine recently did https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html, and I got inspired to do the same.

In December of 2019 I did the annual [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2019). In that year you have to implement a VM, that can execute "intCode".
Inspired by that I decided to implement an Assembly language on top of that, and eventually even a "high level" language, that I call "intScript".

During the pandemic of 2020, I designed and implemented a hardware computer for intCode (blog post tbd).

If I complete the ray tracer in intScript, I in theory, would have done the full tech from wires to ray tracer all the way!
